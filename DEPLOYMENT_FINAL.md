## 📊 Credit Economy Overview

### **Credits = Platform Currency**
```
User Journey:
1. Buy Credits ($10 → 1000 Credits)
2. Use Credits to:
   - Call AI models (pay per use)
   - Buy resources from marketplace
   - Deposit gets 90% Credits (10% fee)
3. Earn Credits by:
   - Depositing API keys to pool
   - Selling resources on marketplace
```

### **Pricing Model**
```
Provider Cost → Platform Pricing (with profit)

Example (Llama 3.1 8B):
- Provider: $0.282/M tokens
- Platform: 0.45 Credits/1K tokens
- Profit Margin: ~60%
```

### **Two Revenue Streams**
1. **Marketplace** (P2P Trading):
   - 15% platform commission
   - Users set their own prices
   
2. **Resource Pool** (Bank Model):
   - 10% deposit fee
   - Spread between cost and charged price
   - Smart routing for optimization
